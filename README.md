# EmbeddingInput
This work surrounds the use of a classifier trained on ImageNet as an embedder (predicts 1000 classes).
Using this embedder we train a smaller network, of 3 layers.

You can run it by going into the SARL folder, and running main.py
It has currently only been tested for SARL tasks, specifically CarRacing-v2, future work involves testing MARL tasks ++
